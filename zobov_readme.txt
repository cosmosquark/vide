This is the readme file for ZOBOV (ZOnes Bordering On Voidness),
version 1.0 (Jan 5, 2008) a void-finding algorithm for sets of
particles (e.g. a cosmological N-body simulation) by Mark Neyrinck.
It is an inversion of the halo-finding algorithm VOBOZ (VOronoi BOund
Zones), which was also written by Mark Neyrinck, with the guidance of
Nick Gnedin and Andrew Hamilton.

The gz file which once contained this file should include the
following files:

Makefile    jozov.c      readme.txt  voz1b1.c   voztie.c
findrtop.c  readfiles.c  voz.h       vozinit.c  vozutil.c

For instructions on installing and running ZOBOV, please see
http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~neyrinck/zobov/.  To use ZOBOV, you will
need to download the Qhull package, at http://www.qhull.org.  For help
in understanding ZOBOV, please see the paper describing it
(arXiv:0712.3049), If these resources are insufficient, feel free to
email Mark.Neyrinck@colorado.edu with questions.

This is free software.  It may be freely copied, modified, and
redistributed, as long as ZOBOV and its author are acknowledged.
There is no warranty or other guarantee of fitness for ZOBOV; it is
provided "as is."  I welcome bug reports (but do not guarantee their
fixing), which should be sent to Mark.Neyrinck@colorado.edu.
